### Hey everyone! I built a completely free flashcard app to help you learn vocabulary, and I'd love your feedback!

I've been working on this project for a while and I'm really excited to share it with the community. It's a vocabulary builder that uses flashcards and a spaced repetition algorithm to help you learn and retain new words more effectively.

Here are some of the key features:

*   **9 Languages Supported:** Learn vocabulary in English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Hebrew, and Japanese.
*   **Create Custom Sections:** Organize your vocabulary into different sections or topics that make sense for you.
*   **Full Word Management:** You can add, edit, and delete words in your sections at any time.
*   **Upload from Excel:** If you already have a list of words in an Excel file, you can easily upload them to the app.
*   **SM2 Spaced Repetition Algorithm:** The app uses the SM2 algorithm to schedule your reviews, so you see words you're about to forget more often.
*   **Clean & Simple Interface:** I've tried to make the interface as clean and intuitive as possible.
*   **Completely Free:** No ads, no subscriptions, no hidden costs. It's just a free tool for language learners.

I built this because I wanted a simple, no-nonsense tool to help me with my own language learning, and I hope it can be useful for others as well.

I would love to hear what you think! Any feedback, suggestions, or bug reports would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks for checking it out!
